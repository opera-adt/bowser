## Philosophy

- **Readability, reproducibility, performance – in that order.**
- Prefer explicit over implicit; avoid hidden state and global flags.
- Measure before you optimize (`time.perf_counter`, `line_profiler`).
- Each module holds a **single responsibility**; keep public APIs minimal.

## Docstrings & Comments

- Style: NumPyDoc.
- Start with a one‑sentence summary in the imperative mood.
- Sections: Parameters, Returns, Raises, Examples, References.
- Cite peer‑reviewed papers with DOI links when relevant.
- Inline comments explain *why*, not what. For example, *don't* write:

```python
# open the file
f = open(filename)
```

## Type Hints

- Annotate all public functions (PEP 484).
- Prefer `Protocol` over `ABC`s when only an interface is needed.
- Validate external inputs via Pydantic models (if existing); otherwise, use `dataclasses`

## Documentation

- mkdocs + Jupyter. Hosted on ReadTheDocs.
- Auto API from type hints.
- Provide tutorial notebooks covering common workflows.
- Include examples in docstrings.
- Add high-level guides for key functionality.
